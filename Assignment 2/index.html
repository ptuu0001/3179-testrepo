      What Makes A Country Liveable?

    <p>
      What makes a country liveable? These are some questions I wondered while sipping on my morning coffee. So I
      decided, why not write an article on this topic. While doing my research I found there are many factors that
      determines a country’s liveability. While this article cannot account for all of them, it can at least show some
      of the main contributing factors.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there are factors known as the
      determinants of health that influence an individual’s health (World Health Organisation [WHO], 2017). These
      determinants of health include but are not limited to social, economic situation, physical living environment and
      individual’s behaviour. This article will explore various factors that can affect individual’s livelihood and see
      how they compare against other countries.
    </p>
    <div id="chloro_map" class="vis-container"></div>
    <p>
      The World Happiness Report is an annual survey that collates various quality of life factors and bases their
      ranking on countries on a happiness score (Wikipedia, 2021). The happiness score is determined by individuals
      answering this question:
      <br />
    <div id="quote">
      ‘Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10
      at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for
      you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for
      you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you
      stand at this time?’ (Helliwell, Huang, Wang, & Norton, 2021).
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      As the name suggests, a higher score would mean a country/its citizens are happier. While the rest of the graphs
      and visualisations in this article may not directly contribute to the happiness scoring process, they are
      definitely still factors that influences an individual’s happiness level. It would seem that most developed
      countries appear to have relatively happy citizens, while developing countries are more likely to be unhappy.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Though one critique I would like to add on the Happiness Report, is that it doesn’t consider exceptional
      circumstances that may influence an individual’s psyche. As an example, if a person recently had a break-up, they
      would likely be at a very low point in their life. If they were to score their happiness, it may not accurately
      reflect how they feel about their happiness levels overall, since they are still dealing with an emotional event
      in their life.
    </p>
    <div id="corrupt_bubble_chart" class="vis-container"></div>
    <p>
      Freedom to make life choices is another question that was asked in the World Happiness Report, where people were
      asked:
    <div id="quote">
      ‘Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?’ (Helliwell,
      Huang, & Wang, 2021).
    </div>
    Multiple factors can contribute to how this question was answered. Some contexts can include if they are
    experiencing any economic burden, their current mental wellbeing, their country’s current political landscape or
    extraneous factors that are out of their control, such as a broken bone limiting their mobility; again a weakness
    of the happiness report.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      For perception of corruption, users were asked if:
    <div id="quote">
      ‘Corruption was widespread throughout the government or not’ and ‘Is corruption widespread within businesses or
      not?’
      (Helliwell et al., 2021).
    </div>
    Having a lower score, would mean the country would be perceived as more corrupt.
    <br>
    It mostly does seem that having corrupt governments would correlate to a lower happiness score, but it does seem
    to affect in the scoring of ‘freedom to make life choices’. Perhaps this may indicate that despite being aware of
    their corrupt governments, it does not impede their daily activities, so they still feel a sense of freedom. What
    is your interpretation?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      One more thing I like to point out is an outlier for the country Rwanda (you can see it by adjusting the happiness
      score range to be between 2.5 and 3.5, located on the top-right corner). Despite having a low corruption score
      (0.41) and high ‘freedom to make life choices’ score (0.56), it seems to be quite an unhappy country with a score
      of 3.33.
    </p>
    <div id="social_happy_scatter_plot" class="vis-container"></div>
    <p>
      In the context of the Happiness Report, social support refers to the question:
    <div id="quote">
      ‘If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or
      not?’ (Helliwell et al., 2021).
    </div>
    It is not difficult to see how the correlation of social support affects happiness. Forming close and meaningful
    relationships and having a supportive network of friends, is a contributing factor in an individual’s social
    health. It should be noted that the question does not refer to external services such as therapy or consultations.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Healthy life expectancy, as the name suggests, is how well an individual is expected to live a fulfilling life,
      without worrying about illness or injuries that can affect their daily basis of life. We can see how having social
      support from others correlates to people being more likely happy, while still being able to lead healthy lives.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="pure-g" style="width: 1300px; margin:0 auto; padding-top: 2rem;">
    <div class="pure-u-1-2">
      <div id="life_expect_range_dotplot"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-u-1-2">
      <div id="avg_life_expect"></div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="page-col">
    <div id="life_expect_line_chart" class="vis-container"></div>

    <p>
      We can see that overtime life expectancy has risen for the entire world, including countries on an individual
      level. Factors such as advancements in medicines, better understanding in managing and treating diseases, better
      safety standards, introduction of hygienic practices and access to medical care all contributed to higher overall
      life expectancy (Friedman, 2015).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Notice how around 1914 and 1945 there was a considerable dip in the average life expectancy for a few countries,
      especially for Russia. This was because of World War I and World War II, where millions lost their lives fighting
      in the global conflict causing a dramatic drop in life expectancy for participating countries.
      However, there is still a disproportionate difference between developing and developed countries (not represented
      that well in the line graph, due to the small dataset). India, still being a developing country is overtaken by
      most developed countries by at least 10 years. This is often generalised to the lack of access to standard health
      care services.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Being able to access healthcare is one of the most important factors on affecting the average life expectancy in
      any country. It is in a country’s best interest to provide universal healthcare system, that is accessible for
      everyone, regardless of economic and environmental circumstances (Shimizu, n.d.). The treatment or prevention of
      illness and injuries all fall under the umbrella term of healthcare. Having healthcare systems with a strong
      foundation, means an individual can recover quickly and resume to enjoying their life without being burdened by
      any unexpected caveats, such as high payment fees.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Countries such as South Korea, Denmark and Australia are widely regarded as countries with the best healthcare
      systems in the world (World Population Review, 2021). They all share in common having a free universal healthcare,
      that is accessible to all their citizens regardless of their circumstances.
    </p>
    <div id="social_score_chloro" class="vis-container"></div>
    <p>
      The economic freedom index is an annual ranking created by The Heritage Foundation, that measures the economic
      freedom from around the world. As stated by foundation, a country is considered to be economically free when
      <i>‘individuals are free to work, produce, consume, and invest in any way they please’</i> and <i>‘governments
        allow labor, capital, and goods to move freely, and refrain from coercion or constraint of liberty…’ </i> (The
      Heritage Foundation, 2021a).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      There are twelve factors which are used to determine the economic freedom score. They are grouped as:
    <ul>
      <li>Rule of law</li>
      <li>Government size</li>
      <li>Regulatory efficiency</li>
      <li>Open markets</li>
    </ul>
    However, for the purpose of keeping this article at a reasonable length, we are only going to focus on the
    category regulatory efficiency and one aspect from the open market category, to give the data a nice mix.

            <b>Labour freedom (regulatory efficiency):</b>
            <br>
            Labour freedom is a quantitative measurement where various factors
            concerning a country’s labour market and regulations, such as minimum wage or mandatory severance pay are
            considered to the score (The Heritage Foundation, 2021b).

            <b>Business freedom (regulatory efficiency):</b>
            <br>
            Business freedom measure the efficacy of government regulation of businesses (The Heritage Foundation,
            2021c). Such factors that are measured include starting business costs or starting business minimum capital.

            <b>Monetary freedom (regulatory efficiency):</b>
            <br>
            Monetary freedom measures how stable the market is, by measuring the price stability and price controls (The
            Heritage Foundation, 2021d). Ideally, intervention and inflation should be kept at a minimum to not disrupt
            market activity.

        <div class="description description-right">
          <p style="margin-left: -4rem;">
            <b>Trade freedom (open markets): </b>
            <br>
            Trade freedom is a composite measurement of both the absence of tariffs and non-tariff barriers that impede
            the imports and exports of goods and services (The Heritage Foundation, 2021e). Countries ideally should be
            able to internationally trade with each other, without barriers that impede the flow of goods and services
            to ensure a free market.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Doing a bit of light analysis of the histograms, labour freedom and business freedom graphs appear to be evenly
      distributed, with the business freedom graph being a bit more skewed on the right. Monetary freedom and trade
      freedom histograms seem to be doing well in terms of their respective freedoms.

      As a heads up, yes. North Korea has scored the lowest score out of all the countries, even having their monetary
      freedom and trade freedom scoring at an unbelievable <b>zero</b>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Reiterating my points again, there are so many factors that contribute to the liveability of the country that this
      article cannot cover all of them. If you are interested in this topic, reading the about the determinants of
      health, as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is a great overall and guideline of aspects that affect
      an individual’s wellbeing.
